         * MORIS to program similar to the syntax of MATLAB Linear algebra and to provide a
         * suite of operations/functions. Rather than write these operations functions,
         * we interface with third party libraries (TPLs) to provide the implementation.

         * templating will not be discussed here, but in general expression templates
         * allow for compiler optimization of series a linear algebra operations and prevent
         * unnecessary copies of matrixes to be made along the way. To show the benefit of
         * expression templates a comparison of times with and without using
         * expression templates is shown here. for the operations
