/** @defgroup HMR_Lagrange_Mesh Lagrange Mesh

Like the BSpline_Mesh, the Lagrange_Mesh is a child class of Mesh_Base. A Lagrange mesh contains Nodes and Lagrange elements, as well as a pointer to the B-Spline mesh it is liked with. A Lagrange Mesh contains Lagrange Elements and nodes.

<b>Lagrange_Element</b>

The Lagrange element is a child class of Element. It has an array of Lagrange_Node pointers and a pointer to the corresponding BSpline_Element on the B-Spline mesh. This pointer is needed in order to calculate the T-Matrices. In this context, the corresponding B-Spline element is called <i>twin</i>.

<b>Lagrange_Node</b>

The Lagrange Node is a child class of Basis. It is defined by
- its proc local ijk position
- its global xyz position
- its T-Matrix
- a Vector of pointers to its defining B-Splines.
