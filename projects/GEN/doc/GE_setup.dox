/** @defgroup GE_setup Setup and Use
    
First, a geometry representation (GR) must be created via the factory using one of the following options:
    
1) <b> Option 1 - Discrete </b>
    
\f$   \phi_{nodal}^{i} = T_{nodal} \times BsplineCoeffs   \f$
       
The use of this option will require a target field to map to during initalization. 
       
2) <b> Option 2 - Discrete </b>
    
\f$   \phi_{nodal}^{i} = T_{radial filter} \times p   \f$
        
<p> &emsp; Where <b> p </b> is a set of user-defined parameters. </p>
        
The use of this option will require a target field to map to during initalization.
        
3) <b> Option 3 - Analytic </b>
    
\f$   \phi_{nodal}^{i} = f(p)   \f$
        
<p> &emsp; Where <b> p </b> is a set of user-defined parameters. </p>
        
The use of this option does not require a target field as the field is already fully defined. 
        
4) <b> Option 4 - SDF </b>
    
\f$   \phi_{nodal}^{i} = SDF(p)   \f$
        
<p> &emsp; Where <b> p </b> is a set of user-defined parameters. </p>
        
The use of this option does not require a target field as the field is already fully defined. 
    
Once the GR is defined, the GE can be created. The GE takes in a GR along with its associated mesh and stores them in a list. 

Next, the GE must perform its initalization step. Depending on the type of the GR, the initalization may result in a projection onto the target field. Regardless, 
the initalization step sets up the container which holds all the relevant information (referred to as PDV_Type_Info objects) and registers it in a list whose index
corresponds to the index of the associated GR. 

The target field may be defined in many ways. For example, it may be an analytically defined level set field or a collection of geometric primitives 
or a signed distance field. 

Additionaly, the GE has the ability to evaluate a field given a set of paramaters.
