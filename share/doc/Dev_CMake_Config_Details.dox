/** @page ExplainConfig

Config files are used by CMake when it looks for a package using the find_package command. Having these makes moris available to other packages that look to link it to their own code. The config file is also useful for giving users information about the paths CMake found and the libraries needed by each project. 

Recall @ref ConfigInstallSec where the file @p PROJConfig.cmake.in was given as an argument to @p configure_package_config_file. Among other things, this function configures the file it was given. When CMake configures a file, it replaces any variable surrounded by \@ with that variable's value. In the first section of this code, labeled @type{CMake configuration}, @p \@PACKAGE_INIT\@ will be replaced by CMake code created for config files as part of @p configure_package_config_file.

    # - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    # CMake configuration

    \@PACKAGE_INIT\@

Under the second section, @type{MORIS configuration}, the @p set_and_check function sets the package's @p INCLUDE_DIRS variable to the package's include directory and checks that the directory exists. When other packages use your package, they will add the @p INCLUDE_DIRS directory to the search path.

    # Set *_INCLUDE_DIRS
    set_and_check(\@PROJECT\@_INCLUDE_DIRS \@PACKAGE_LIB_INSTALL_DIR\@)

The last part of this file includes the generated file containing the targets we exported in the @ref ConfigInstallSec. It allows the user to reference the targets you exported in their own project.
