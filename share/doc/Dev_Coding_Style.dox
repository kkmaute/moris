/** \defgroup CodingStyle Coding Style

This section contains all coding style guidelines related to the MORIS project. 
They are organized by @ref GenRules, @ref CodingVars, @ref CodingClasses, @ref CodingFunctions,
@ref FileNaming, and @ref CodingMisc.

To support a uniform and consistent formating, enable the moris formatting style in eclipse. Make sure that repeatedly applying eclipse's formatter
does not change the code. 
<BR>


@section GenRules General Rules

Special emphasis is given to the following cardinal rules: 
- Each statement shall always be in a <b>  separate line </b>, however small it may appear.
- There are <b> no double blank lines. </b>
- There is an <b> 80 character line length limit </b>
- <b> Do not use </b> functions like <b> alloca </b>, <b> inline </b> or any <b> Real pointers</b>. Use moris::Mat instead.
- Use functions as much as possible. Not only to <b> avoid duplicate code </b> , but also to  <b> increase readability and modularity  </b> of the code.
- Moris ID type: Moris_ID
- To aid in implicit conversion issues, always wite real numbers as follows: \f$ 5.0 \f$ (instead of just \f$ 5\f$).

Every line of code should have a comment proceeding it, such that one can read the comments only and understand the code. 
Those comments should contain additional information about the operation which follows (e.g. references to books, papers). <br> 

For example: <br> 

@code{.cpp}
        // Compute first and second order ghost penalty contributions using a displacement gradient based formulation.
        // C.f. Burman and Hansbo 2011, Fictitious domain methods using cut elements: III. A stabilized Nitsche method for Stokes’ problem
        
        this->compute_ghost_pen_disp_grad();
@endcode

In general, all comments should be written in <b> doxygen format</b>. For a quick introduction in doxygen commenting, the reader is referred to 
<a href="https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html ">here</a>.
Also make sure to <b>spell-check comments</b>. Names like <b>Euler, Lagrange, Gauss, Voigt, ... </b> are always capitalized!
<BR>


@section CodingVars Variables
The following guidelines apply to variables.

@subsection NamingVars Naming Variables
Use clear and concise names for variables. If a variable's name is to have 
multiple words, it should become increasingly accurate from right to left (i.e. 
Adjectives always go left). For example, @p userId should be used over 
@p idUser. Both are obviously some type of identification, thus "user" is 
the adjective that describes the Id. When variables have names with multiple 
words, use camelCase to distinguish each word. If a variable is of a particular kind,
use an appropriate prefix (see @ref Prefixes). Finally, common words should be 
abbreviated (see @ref Abv).

@subsection Prefixes Prefixes
When naming variables, use the following prefixes depending on the type of variable:
- Member variable: <b>m-</b> (e.g., mVals, mNumRows)
- Argument variable: <b>a-</b> (e.g., aVals, aInputParameter)
- Temporary variable: <b>t-</b> (e.g., tMatrix, tTotalSum)
- Static variable in an input file: <b>s-</b> (e.g., sUseWeakBCs, sWeakBcParam)

@code{.cpp}
// Member variables
real mVals     = 5.0;
uint mNumRows  = 1;

// Function arguments
function( real aVals, uint aInputParameter )
{

}

// Temporary variables
Mat< real > tMatrix ( 3, 3, 0.0 );
real  tTotalSum = 0.0;

// Static variables (only used in input files)
static const bool sUseWeakBCs  = true;
static const real sWeakBcParam = 1.0;
@endcode

@subsection Abv Abbreviations
The following abbreviations are approved in moris:
- Glb - Global (e.g. mGlbIDs)
- Loc - Local (e.g. mLocIDs)
- Id - 1-based IDs (e.g. aNodeId)
- Ind - 0-based index (e.g. aElementInd)
- num or Num - number (i.e. tNumElements, tNumNodes)


@subsection DeclareVars Declaring Variables
When declaring variables, use the following guidelines:

- Auto style: only use if output type is not definitive, for example when third-party libraries or
  expression templates are used.
- Declare and initialize <b>one variable at a time. </b> For example,

@code{.cpp}
uint tAnInteger, tAnotherInteger; // BAD!
  
uint tAnInteger;                  // BAD!
uint tAnotherInteger;
  
uint tAnInteger  = 1;             // GOOD!
real tRealNumber = 5.0;
@endcode

- The characters '*' and '@& ' should be written <b>together with the types of 
variables</b> instead of with the names of variables in order to emphasize that 
they are part of the type definition.

@code{.cpp}
uint *tAnIntPointer        // BAD!
uint &tAnIntByReference    // BAD!

uint* tAnIntPointer        // GOOD!
uint& tAnIntByReference    // GOOD!
@endcode
<BR>


@section CodingClasses Classes
The following guidelines apply to classes.

@subsection NamingClasses Naming Classes
Class names should be always be <b>capitalized</b>. Further, if a class name will use more
than one word, each should be  capitalized and they should be <b>separated with underscores </b><br> .
For example: <br> 
@code{.cpp}
class Tensor_Mesh
{

}

class Structural_Element_Nonlinear
{

}
@endcode

@subsection OrgClasses Organizing Classes
Classes should list their member functions and variables in the following order:
- public
- protected
- private
<BR>

@section CodingFunctions Functions
The following guidelines apply to functions. 

Functions should always be separated by a blank line, a <b> line of dashes </b> and another blank line. 
The total number of characters in the separator line is 80.
@code{.cpp}
void
function_one(
uint aArgument1,
uint aArgument2,
real aArgument3 )
{

}

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

uint
function_two(
uint aArgument )
{

}

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

void
function_three(
uint aArgument1,
uint aArgument2,
real aArgument3 )
{

}
@endcode

<B> NOTE </B> - Constructors (and destructors) are an exception to this rule because 
C++ requires that a Constructor have the same name as the class.

@subsection NamingFuncs Naming Functions
Functions, regardless of whether they are members of a class or not,
should have <b> lower-cased names</b>. If a function name includes multiple words, they
should be <b>separated by underscores </b>.
For example: <br> 
@code{.cpp}
fill()

set_size()

copy_size()
@endcode

@subsection DeclareFunctions Declaring Functions
This guide will use the word 'tab' when referring to guidelines regarding 
indentation. Note that <b>1 'tab' is 4 regular spaces</b>. This is will be part of the 
group's  Eclipse preferences (see @ref Importing for details 
on importing preferences). When declaring functions, you should use the 
following guidelines:
- Always provide the return type of a function explicitly, if known. 
Otherwise, use @p auto.
When using @p auto, the @p -@> operator followed by @p declrtype should align with the function name (under review).
- When declaring functions, the leading parenthesis is written on the same 
line as the function name with no spaces between them.
- Similarly, the trailing parenthesis is written on the same line as the 
last argument, if any. If the function has no arguments, then the trailing 
parenthesis is written in the same line as the function name.
- Each argument is written on a separate line, in the following order: 
argument type, qualifiers (if any, e.g. @p const or @& ), argument name, 
default values (if any).
- Additionally, if a function has more than one argument, the types are 
left-aligned, then the qualifiers are left-aligned, and so on.
- Function names are indented with one tab (4 spaces).
- The body of a function is indented with two tabs (8 spaces).
- Arguments are indented with three tabs (12 spaces).
- Make sure to add a <b>comprehensive descriptions</b> of the function in the <b>header files</b>.
- Add a <b>brief description</b> of the function in the <b>source files</b>.

For example:

@code{.cpp}
    // Make sure to add a brief description of the function here
    template< typename T >
    void
    choll(
            Mat< T >       & aL,
            Mat< T > const & aA,
            std::string     const & aStr = "lower" )
    {
        aL = arma::chol( aA.data(), aStr.c_str() );
        return;
    }
@endcode

For further discussion on writing functions, see @ref WritingFunctions.
 
@subsection ArgPassing Argument Passing
This section is currently under review.

- Except when the parameter list is clearly defined by the functionality 
of the function use a container (i.e. list) to pass parameters.
- A public member function must never return a non-const reference or 
pointer to member data.
- Pass <b>by value</b> when the function does not want to modify the parameter 
and the value is easy to copy (ints, doubles, char, bool, etc... simple types. 
std::string, std::vector, and all other STL containers are NOT simple types.)
- Pass <b>by const pointer</b> when the value is expensive to copy AND the 
function does not want to modify the value pointed to AND NULL is a valid, 
expected value that the function handles.
- Pass <b>by non-const pointer</b> when the value is expensive to copy AND the 
function wants to modify the value pointed to AND NULL is a valid, expected 
value that the function handles.
- Pass <b>by const reference</b> when the value is expensive to copy AND the 
function does not want to modify the value referred to AND NULL would not be a 
valid value if a pointer was used instead.
- Pass <b>by non-const reference</b> when the value is expensive to copy AND the 
function wants to modify the value referred to AND NULL would not be a valid 
value if a pointer was used instead.
- When writing template functions, there isn't a clear-cut answer because 
there are a few trade offs to consider that are beyond the scope of this 
discussion, but suffice it to say that most template functions take their 
parameters by value or (const) reference, however because iterator syntax is 
similar to that of pointers (asterisk to "dereference"), any template function 
that expects iterators as arguments will also by default accept pointers as 
well (and not check for NULL since the NULL iterator concept has a different 
syntax).
<BR><BR><BR>



@section FileNaming Files
All file names should use <b>no more than 16 characters</b>, including underscores, 
but excluding the extension. Each file should begin with @p <b>op_ for 
operators</b>, @p <b>cl_ for classes</b>, and @p <b>fn_ for functions</b>. Omit 
articles and other unnecessary words from the file name (e.g. @p greater is 
preferred over @p greater_than). For example, @p %op_greater_equal.hpp is an 
acceptable file name for the greater-than-or-equal-to operator. Capitalization
in the file name depends on what the file is for. For example, the Mat classes is
defined in the %cl_Mat.hpp file, while diag() is defined in %fn_diag.hpp.
<BR><BR><BR>

@section CodingMisc Other Conventions

@subsection Other File Conventions
- in h-file: use forward declarations
- in C-file: use regular includes as needed

@subsection OpSpasing Operator Spacing
Operators should be spaced as follows:

- Always use <b>spaces before and after the mathematical and logical operators</b> (e.g. =, +, -, <, >, &&, ||, (, ), [, ],...)
- Do not separate products that use the multiplication sign: *.
- Do not use spaces around ‘.’ or ‘->', nor between unary operators and 
operands.

@code{.cpp}
i ++ // BAD!
i++  // GOOD!


tA=std::pow(tB,3);        // BAD!
tA = std::pow( tB, 3 );   // GOOD!
 
 
tMatrix . resize(); // BAD!
tMatrix.resize();   // GOOD!


tScalar=tMatrix(1,2);       // BAD!
tScalar = tMatrix ( 1, 2 ); // GOOD!


this -> MemberFunction(); // BAD!
this->MemberFunction();   // GOOD!


tA=tB+tC/(tD-tE*tD);             // BAD!
tA = tB + tC / ( tD - tE * tD ); // GOOD!


for(uint ind=0;ind<indMax;++ind)           // BAD!
tA=tB+2.*tC;
    
for ( uint ind = 0; ind < indMax; ++ind )  // GOOD!
{
    tA = tB + 2.0 * tC;
}

@endcode

@subsection OpAlignment Operator Alignment
Operators in consecutive lines should be aligned. This also applies when 
declaring variables with types of different lengths. For example,

@code{.cpp}
tAdvectiveCoefficient = tA1    + tA2 + 5.0; // = and + signs are aligned
tConvectionParameter  = 3.5994 + tA3;
  
tB = 4.0 * tB4; // operators do not need to be aligned
  
tAdv = tB + tA;
@endcode

If a statement is broken up into several lines, the operator should be placed at the end of the leading line 
and not at the beginning of the followiing line. The same applies to brackets.
@code{.cpp}
tA =              // GOOD 
    tA + tB +     // GOOD 
    tC + tD; 
    
tA               // BAD 
   = tA + tB     // BAD 
   + tC + tD; 
@endcode

@subsection IfElseStatements If Else Statements
Curly brackets need to be used for every if, else and else if statement. There should be no blank line after and before curly brackets. 
If case of nested statement, there should be no blank line between lines of of closing curly brackets.
For example,

@code{.cpp}
if ( tA > tB )
{
    if ( tB > tA )
    {
        // lines of code      // GOOD
    }                         // GOOD
}
else if ( !( tA == tC ) && ( tD != tE ) )
{
    if ( tB > tA )
    {
                         // BAD
         // lines of code
                         // BAD
    }
                         // BAD
}
else
{
    // lines of code
}
@endcode 

@subsection SwitchStatements Switch Statements
A switch statement must always contain a default branch which handles 
unexpected cases. The case-statement should not contain parenthesis. In the default case, no break statement should be used.

@code{.cpp}
switch ( VariableName )
{
case ACASE:                               // GOOD
{
    // lines of code
    break;
}
case (ANOTHERCASE):                       // BAD
{
    // lines of code
    break;
}
default: // this is necessary
{
    // If nothing is done here, make sure to add a proper error message
    MORIS_LOG_ERROR<<"Default case has not been implemented yet!";
}
} // end of switch structure
@endcode 

@subsection Checks Checks in the code
In general, as many checks as possible need to be added by the developper for things that could potentially go wrong. 
For example, whenever a division is performed, make sure to check if the divisor is (numerically) zero. 
<br>
This is done by using the equal_to function.
<br>
If so, use one of the following:

@code{.cpp}
// Use defined error messages
if( equal_to( tDivisor, 0.0 ) )
{
    MORIS_LOG_ERROR<<"Division by numerically zero is not allowed!";
}

// Or use moris assert
MORIS_ASSERT( equal_to( tDivisor, 0.0 ) , "Division by numerically zero is not allowed!" );
@endcode 
 
@subsection MapsNmaing Naming of Maps
@note This section is currently under review.

Generic GID and LID to refer to global id and local index. Trilinos does it 
this way. nodeGIDtoNodeLIDmap and nodeLIDtoNodeGIDmap, or nodeBiMap. HV
