/** @defgroup RunningTests How to Run the Tests

To run the unit tests, you must compile the code (see the @ref CompilingCode section).

Afterward, move into the @p test/bin directory and run the executable:

    cd path/to/MORIS/test/bin
    ./test-moris.exe

To view additional details about the tests, run the executable with the @p --success
argument:

    ./test-moris.exe --success

Additionally, if you would like to run only a particular test, use its name as 
an argument (this is the title which appears in the @p TEST_CASE line). For 
example, to run the test for the @p diag function only, use the command:

    ./test-moris.exe moris::diag
*/
}
